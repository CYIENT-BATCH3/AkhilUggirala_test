Include  the standard input and output header file
Start with main function
open the block with {
declare two variables(a,b) to perform add,subtract and division;
declare two variables(sum, diff) of integer type to store the result(integer value) by performing addition and subtraction.
declare a float variable to store the result by dividing a with b.
using scanf() and %d(format specifier for inetger value) input the two integer variables.
assign the sum value of a & b in a variable sum.
print the sum of a & b using printf() and integer format specifier %d.
assign the value to diff-variable by subtracting(a-b) using assignment operator(=).
print the subtracted value of a & b using printf() and integer format specifier %d.
assign a value by performing division for a & b variables to div- variable.
print the divison value of a & b using div- variable and float format specifier %f.
close the main function.
